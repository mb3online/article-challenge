# MB3 Interview Challenges

This exercise is for us to get a better understanding of what level of programming skill you currently poses.

# Exercises

Please complete both the [Web Exercise](/exercises/web) and the [SQL Exercise](/exercises/sql). Further instructions on what the exercises require and how to submit them follow on each description.

If you have any questions you can [submit an issue through github](https://github.com/mb3online/article-challenge/issues/new) or email our technical interviewers Eric ([eric.adamski [AT] mb3online.com](mailto:eric.adamski@mb3online.com)) or Bernie ([bernie.hillier [AT] mb3online.com](mailto:bernie.hillier@mb3online.com))

# Guidelines

The goal here is to casually evaluate your skills; not to stress you out. Please do not spend more than 4 hours on this exercise and try not to focus too long on a single requirement. You can always ask questions by either [submitting an issue through github](https://github.com/mb3online/article-challenge/issues/new) or by emailing our technical interviewer Eric ([eric.adamski [AT] mb3online.com](mailto:eric.adamski@mb3online.com)). We do not focus on the quality of the solution and we do not put any weight on the runtime of the final result.

Please place comments within your code so we can better understand your thought process as you are completing the task. If you cannot get past a certain requirement and have attempted to reach out for clarification or assistance please leave inline code comments explaining your thoughts on why your attempts did not succeed.

# Submission

To submit this exercise please [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) [this repository](https://github.com/mb3online/article-challenge), complete the challenge then make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to [this repository](https://github.com/mb3online/article-challenge) and you will get a chance to review the result during your technical interview.

We will provide you _a_ solution after/during your interview.

**PLEASE spend no longer than 4 hours**
